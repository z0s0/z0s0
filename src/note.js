            <p>Consider the case. Services A exposes GQL API. Services B and C consume this API and do semantically the same thing and use the SAME queries.</p>
            <p>Believe me there are cases when 2 services really need to use the same queries and ALWAYS the same queries.</p>
            <p>From this moment you will make efforts on versioning/sharing this queries.
               If you have 50+ queries to be consistent and shared between services your code is not maintainable yet.

        text: <span>
              <p>Bloating is a known disadvantage of PostgreSQL garbage collection mechanisms.
                 If rows updates are intensive you may decide to automate REINDEX process.</p>
              <p>
                  Fresh versions of PostgreSQL support CONCURRENTLY option.
                  This means that index can still be used in query plans and updates smoothly using second index index_name_ccnew{1,2,3}.
                  Sometimes PostgreSQL `forget` to delete temporary index created. It will never be considered in query plan but still holds space and replicates on followers.
                  If such indexes are heavy replication lag increases to hours.

                The problem is driver's odbc.next_batch function stores previous batch into memory :). OOM kills the app in minutes.
